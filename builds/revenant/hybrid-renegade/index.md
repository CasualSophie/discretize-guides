<Card title="Dealing with No Pain, No Gain">

There are multiple weapons in your arsenal to deal with the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and make it easier to manage the boons that the enemy will receive from this instability. For fractals with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> it is recommended to run a staff with <Item id="72872"/> instead of a <Item id="24615"/>. The <Item id="72872"/> will transfer three boons from enemies to you when you interrupt an attack. For enemies with a defiance bar, using a CC skill while the enemy is casting any ability counts as interrupting, even if there is no "_interrupted_" message.

<Weapons weapon1MainType="Staff" weapon1MainAffix="Diviner" weapon1MainSigil1="Severance" weapon1MainSigil2="Absorption"/>

As for legends that you want to run, the general rule of thumb in groups that perform at least relatively well is to run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. If you find the stability to be an issue on Artsariiv in slower groups where <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> isn't enough to cover the stability, you can run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> or alternatively heavily rely on your <Item id="72872"/> to strip the boons and run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>. However, this isn't recommended due to the unreliability of <Item id="72872"/>.
