<Tab title="Build">

The <Specialization name="dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> was moved to the [offmeta](/builds/) due to the fact that you can not replace a <Specialization name="weaver"/> or <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>. <Specialization title="Power Dragonhunter" name="dragonhunter"/> is a meta build only if it replaces <Specialization name="firebrand" /> and being the main source of <Boon name="quickness"/> by taking <Skill name="feelmywrath"/>, which is used only in short encounters in higher end groups.

<Specialization name="dragonhunter" /> is good and easy to play build for fractals. It has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and <Condition name="vulnerability"/>.

The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with <Skill id="30039"/> and other useful skills such as <Skill id="9251"/>, <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card title="Notes">
* Always start on scepter/sword
* Delay swapping to GS until the CC-bar is about to be broken. This is especially important at Ensolyss without instant CC. 
* Always cast your <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits. Ideal with adds around.
* Always cast your <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits when adds are present. Can be abused at __Siax__ and __Ensolyss__.
* Don't interrupt your GS auto-attack chain.
* In certain scenarios (precasting traps, starting with <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>) it can be beneficial to get your <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> out first.
* Use <Skill id="9098"/> after <Skill id="9090"/> to cancel the aftercast.
* Don't waste your key skills on meaningless adds.
* It's up to you whether you decide to go Scepter or Sword. Sword tends to outperform Scepter, especially in longer encounters.

<Tab title="Mama">

### **Precast**

- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- You can use <Skill name="hallowed ground"/> for fire field and/or <Skill name="standyourground"/>.
- Take the mistlock.

### **Synopsis**

- Start on Scepter/Sword.
- Try to use your full burst (either you start the phase on GS or sword/scepter) in each phase after breakbar is broken.
- Don't forget that you can not expect to see the highest numbers without the breakbar being frequently broken: to make that happen use <Skill name="banesignet"/>. <Specialization name="renegade"/> and <Specialization name="berserker"/> will not break the bar alone without consumables so DO NOT be selfish.
- Do not use traps on the adds.
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> inside MAMAs hitbox, when the small adds are coming close.
- Feel free to use <Skill name="symbol of blades"/>, <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> and <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> for faster movement.
- You can take <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help CC the adds.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Siax">

**General guide**

- Use your <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> inside Siax' hitbox to get 5 additional hits. This is the reason why <Specialization name="guardian"/> is very strong at this boss. Do not miss this.
- Save some <Skill id="9168"/> for a quicker add kill.
- It is beneficial to take a sword here to quickly blink to the add.
- Use <Skill name="Wings of resolve"/> to navigate around and keep your HP up.
- Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and buff your party.
- Use <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and <Skill name="Shieldofcourage"/> to block the expanding AoEs.
- Check with your team if you take <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>

---

### **Precast**

- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss and force your team to `/gg`.
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Take the mistlock.
- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

### **100%-66%**

- Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull.
- If your team has very high DPS (phases Siax in >5s) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.
- No matter what group you are running with, start on scepter/sword!
- If you are running in a PuG or just clear it daily, it is beneficial to delay your traps slightly, to fit more of the hits into the cc bar.
- In a fast team save <Skill name="bindingblade"/> for the 2nd phase when the adds spawn, if not use it. Just make sure to press it when the adds are in range for big DPS.

### _1st Add_

- Use <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> on your add for the modifier from <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>.
- <Skill name="Whirling wrath"/> and a couple AA to kill it.
- Use <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> and <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> for movement.

### **66%-33%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

### _2nd Add_

- Use <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> on your add for the modifier from <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>.
- Kill it with a symbol and AAs.
- In fast runs you might wanna save a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

### **33%-0%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Ensolyss">
### **Precast**
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- You can use <Skill name="hallowed ground"/> for fire field and/or <Skill name="standyourground"/>.
- Take the mistlock.

### **Synopsis**

- Breakbar should be broken at the start of the fight, use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to help to make it happen.
- Start on Scepter/Sword.
- Try to fit every single skill you have into <Effect name="exposed"> (few seconds after the bar is broken), feel free to precast a symbol, and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable.
- After you used your full opener, continue with your usual rotation until you phase.
- Repeat this every single phase.

### **Burn phases**

Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull. If your team has very high DPS (i.e. they phase Skorvald in less than 5 seconds) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.

### **Adds**

You can kill the first two adds with a greatsword. You can use traps on the 2nd add, without having them on cooldown when you are back at Skorvald. Make sure, that you are on scepter/sword at the last add and you are not having cooldown on the weapon swap, or you DPS will suffer a lot. You can freely use Traps and GS on the first two adds. Swap to scepter/sword after that.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Artsariiv">
**General**
- If your team does not have a <Specialization name="soulbeast"/>, you can take <Skill name="Wall of reflection"/> for reflects. Please don't steal the reflect from a <Specialization name="soulbeast"/>!
- Use <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> strategically to block the <Control name="Knockback"/> attacks.
- Save a <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> or <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> for the expanding AoE so you can deal continues DPS during the mid burn.

---

### **Precast**

- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- Take the mistlock.
- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss in a coordinated team.

### **100%**

- If you are not skipping the first Anomaly, you should place the <Skill name="wallofreflection"/> in the middle.
- Again it is recommended to start on scepter or sword.
- Use your <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and boost the party DPS as soon as Artsariiv arrives at the corners.
- Always use <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> and <Skill name="Whirlingwrath"/> inside Artsariivs hitbox for big damage.

### _Adds_

- Help your team CCing with [consumables](/guides/consumables).
- Swap to scepter and camp it to be ready for the mid burst.
- Do not waste your <Skill name="banesignet"/> or <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> (GS5) for this.
- Use your _Hypernova Launch_ to quickly navigate to adds.

### **66% and 33%**

- When all adds are broken, your traps will be off cooldown again.
- Start on scepter again, use <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/> to block the expanding AoE and fire everything you have.
- When Artsariiv arrives at the corners again immediately place your <Skill name="Wall of reflection"/>.
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Arkk">
### **Precast**
- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss.

### **Synopsis**

- Play scepter here!
- Good teams: start on scepter/sword, so that you are on scepter during the bloom phase.
- Bad teams: start on greatsword and do SC rotation
- Your goal is to start on scepter/sword at every 10% burn phase, that is why you need to consider weapon swaps carefully.
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> to pull adds. Do not abuse it to farm DPS! Not pulling the adds might kill you during the bloom phase and cost more DPS!
- Cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> early, so you get more DPS time.
- There are two ways to do the blooms fast:
  1. Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the scepter. Use <Skill name="Wings of Resolve"/> to jump back to the middle.
  2. Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the greatsword. After the bloom bounces towards the pillar use <Skill name="Leap of faith"/> on the bloom to finish it. Immediately use _Hypernova Launch_ to jump back into the middle.
