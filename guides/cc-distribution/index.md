## Basics of Crowd Control:

<Card title="What is a Defiance bar?">

The [Defiance bar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar) (also called a breakbar) is a very important mechanic in fractals mainly due to its ability to let players do more damage to a mob for a certain amount of time after breaking it.

Usually elite or higher mobs will have a defiance bar in fractals, your goal should be to break this bar as fast as possible. In order to break a defiance bar, you need to use CC skills on the enemy whose breakbar you want to break. The size of the bar varies from boss to boss and between mobs too, what matters is that you should break it.

Once you break an enemy's defiance bar they will gain an effect named <Effect name="exposed"/>, which means they take **50% more damage**. They will also usually be <Control name="Stun"/>, which means they are unable to attack you or deal damage to you.
</Card>
This guide's aim is to help you understand how your team should cooperate to break all the CC bars.
The present <Specialization name="firebrand"/> + <Specialization name="renegade"/> meta demands CC contributions from every member of the party, **even of the DPS players!**
A list of CC skills along with their defiance bar damage can be found on each class respective [Build page](/builds).

In Tier 4 fractals (T4) a breakbar usually does not exceed 600 units, nevertheless, it is everyone's responsibility to break bars as quickly as possible.
In PuG (Pick up Group, players from the LFG system) runs, where you can rely on the fact that 4 out of 5 people did not read this page it is very much recommended to make up for their lack of CC with [CC consumables](/guides/consumables).

**Using Crowd Control effectively is the key to success in almost all fractals! A fast break will decrease kill times by a large margin even if your party underperforms in every other aspect!**

<Card title="What does CC mean?">
CC is an acronym for [Crowd Control](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Control_effect). A Crowd Control skill is any skill that disables an enemy or even a group of enemies and therefore deals damage to a defiance bar, it can be split into soft CC or hard CC

**Hard CC** skills usually inflict the enemy with some kind of movement effect like <Control name="Stun"/> or <Control name="Knockback"/>. As they disable the enemy right now they deal defiance bar damage **instantaneously**. This is the most commonly used type of CC skills to break a defiance bar.

**Soft CC** skills are those which apply conditions, they inflict damage to the Defiance bar **over time**, depending upon the condition. Since you want to get the <Effect name="exposed"/> effect as soon as possible you can't rely on soft CC breaking a bar of 2000 as seen below it will take quite a while.
</Card>
<Card title="Soft CC table">
| Condition | CC per second |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| <Condition name="Fear"/> | 100 per second |
| <Condition name="Taunt"/> | 75 per second |
| <Condition name="Immobile"/> | 50 per second |
| <Condition name="slow"/> | 50 per second |
| <Condition name="chilled"/> | 33 per second |
| <Condition name="Blinded"/> | 20 per second |
| <Condition name="Weakness"/> | 20 per second |
| <Condition name="Crippled"/> | 15 per second |

## Challenge Mode CC distribution

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Mama">
<Divider text="MAMA"/>

At 1800 MAMA has a small defiance bar, but you need to break it three times during the fight. In combination with the Knights that have defiance bars of 800, each MAMA becomes the most CC heavy fractal boss in the game.
<Divider text="restricted"/>
When playing without CC Consumables, the <Specialization name="Berserker"/> needs to take an offhand mace with <Item id="24639"/> in addition to <Skill name="wildblow"/> and <Skill name="bullscharge"/>, and the <Specialization name="firebrand"/> needs to bring <Skill name="HammerofWisdom"/> instead of <Skill name="sword of justice"/>.

<Image src="./images/mama_restricted.png" caption="Restricted Mama CC distribution by Dissect [Dc]"/>
<Divider text="unrestricted"/>
When playing with CC consumables, the <Specialization name="firebrand"/> can keep <Skill name="sword of justice"/>.

<Image src="./images/mama_unrestricted.png" caption="Unrestricted Mama CC distribution with consumables"/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Siax">
<Divider text="Siax"/>
At 2000 Siax has a medium-sized defiance bar that you should only have to break once if you are fast.

You can always use a <Item name="metalrod"/> if you don't trust your group.

<Image src="./images/siax.png" caption="Siax CC distribution"/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Ensolyss">
<Divider text="Ensolyss"/>
At 2000 in the first phase, and ~2250 in the second and third phase, Ensolyss has sizeable defiance bars that need to be broken fast to avoid a time loss in the first phase and to prevent the team from taking damage in the second and third phase. The small time window for breaking the first bar means that everyone in the party **MUST** contribute.
<Divider text="phase 1"/>
<Image src="./images/enso_1.png" caption="Ensolyss Phase 1 CC distribution"/>
<Divider text="phase 2 and 3"/>
The bigger bar in the second and third phase means that the <Specialization name="Berserker"/>  needs to do an extra <Skill name="pommelbash"/> and that the weaver needs to do an extra <Skill name="polaricleap"/>.

<Image src="./images/enso_2.png" caption="Ensolyss Phase 2 and 3 CC distribution"/>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Skorvald">
<Divider text="Skorvald"/>
At 2200 Skorvald the Shattered has one of the largest defiance bars out of all the Challenge Mode fractal bosses, meaning that the whole group needs to contribute to break it quickly.

If the <Specialization name="renegade"/> precasts <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/> and has decent positioning, getting 5 hits of <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/>, then the <Specialization name="berserker"/> can forgo offhand mace in favour of a warhorn (with <Item id="24639"/>) for blasting <Boon name="Might"/> on the islands.

<Image src="./images/skorvald.png" caption="Skorvald CC distribution"/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Artsariiv">
<Divider text="Artsariiv"/>
At 2100 Artsariiv has a large defiance bar that needs to be broken quickly for the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> to land their reflect into <Effect name="exposed"/>. Luckily you have *Hypernova Launch* working in your favour, which the <Specialization name="renegade"/> should utilize by canceling his <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> with it, causing it to hit 9 times, resulting in 1350 defiance bar damage. This property of *Hypernova Launch* can be used to get more hits with any movement skills, like warrior's <Skill name="whirlwindattack"/> (Greatsword 3) and Fiery Greatsword's <Skill name="fierywhirl"/> (FGS 3).

The remaining 750 defiance bar damage should come from the <Specialization name="firebrand"/>'s <Skill name="Banesignet"/> and from <Specialization name="berserker"/>'s <Skill name="headbutt"/> and either <Skill name="Tremor"/> or <Skill name="updraft"/> from <Specialization name="weaver"/> if the <Specialization name="berserker"/> isn't bringing an offhand mace.

<Image src="./images/artsariiv.png" caption="Artsariiv CC distribution"/>
<Divider text="split phase adds"/>

The easiest and fastest way to break the defiance bars on the split-phase clones is with [crowd control consumables](/guides/consumables). This also means you don't need to waste any DPS skills to CC these adds.

- For the first split phase at 66% you want to use a <Item name="rock"/> followed by either a <Item name="termiteshovel"/> or <Item name="metalrod"/>.
- For the second split phase at 33% you can use either a <Item name="sentinelrifle"/>, 2 <Item name="rock"/>s or a <Item name="termiteshovel">.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Arkk">
<Divider text="Arkk"/>
At 1800 Arkk has a small defiance bar that appears after the bloom pushing phase at 80%, 50% and 30%. Once again you have the *Hypernova Launch* working in your favour, which in addition to causing <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> to hit 9 times, the <Effect name="Launch"/> from *Hypernova Launch* will also double-hit, bringing the <Specialization name="renegade"/>'s defiance bar damage to 1814 alone!

The only reason the <Specialization name="berserker"/> carries an off-hand mace on Arkk is to get the <Item name="severance"/> buff by precasting <Skill name="Tremor"/> after each bloom phase.
