## Usage of `/gg`

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
You can use the chat command `/gg` within fractals to immediately kill your character (dead, not downed). This can be used generously in fractal skips, as it allows the entire party to teleport to a checkpoint once one player activates it.

If everyone in the party is dead at the same time, cooldowns will reset for all players. Therefore it is advised for the entire group to use `/gg` at certain key positions to reset long cooldowns, like between Siax (2nd boss) and Ensolyss (3rd boss) in 99CM. Never resurrect as long as another player is still alive.

Note that the <Specialization name="druid"/>'s <Skill id="31869"/> and <Skill name="Reapers Shroud"/> for <Specialization name="reaper"/> will fully recharge after the resurrection.

## Mistlock Instabilities

Tier 4 fractals always have three Mistlock Instabilities active which add additional mechanics to the fights. The selection is random for each difficulty level and changes daily. More information can be found [in the official wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists).

Below is a list of all current instabilities and their possible countermeasures.

|                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| <Instability name="Adrenaline Rush"/>     | When enraged, enemies deal 150% increased damage while they're low on health. Enemies deal 20% less damage when not enraged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| <Instability name="Afflicted"/>           | Outgoing <Boon name="resistance"/> duration is increased by 50%. Enemies apply random conditions. (<Condition name="bleeding"/>, <Condition name="burning"/>, <Condition name="confusion"/>, <Condition name="poisoned"/> and <Condition name="torment"/>). Not necessary, although a good countermeasure is to have the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> use <Skill id="45460"/> or blasting light fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/>           | This means that players in combat are randomly marked with Flux Bombs which leave a damaging and blinding AoE field behind. Do not place those inside the combat area, learn to dash away right before the field deploys. If you keep walking forward while marked you won't get any damage from the bomb. Flux bombs now apply to both allies and enemies. **_It is a little DPS increase to deploy it under the boss/mobs but it is not worth it blinding your team members!_**                                                                                                                                                                     |
| <Instability name="Last Laugh"/>          | Enemies explode upon dying if not stunned. Stunned enemies apply protection and stability to nearby players. Each enemy killed explodes within a 180 radius 1.75 seconds after its death, dealing high damage and apply <Control name="daze"/> to foes around it. Recognizable by a yellow zone after a mob's death. Stunned enemies apply <Boon name="protection"/> and <Boon name="stability"/> to nearby players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| <Instability name="Mists Convergence"/>   | Causes a set of effects from other fractals to spawn, including _The Mossman_, a deadly _Champion Rabbit_, _Veteran Jade Maw Tentacles_, an _air strike_ from the PvP map Skyhammer and the _cannon assault_ from Captain Mai Trin Fractal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>    | Enemies receive <Boon name="protection"/>, <Boon name="might"/> and <Boon name="fury"/> when you hit them. Has a 20 second internal cooldown per enemy, <Specialization name="renegade"/> can strip with <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> (<Skill name="Legendary Demon stance"/>) or <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> can strip with <Skill name="Well of Corruption"/> and weapon skills or <Skill name="Throw mine"/> from <Specialization name="holosmith"/> or <Specialization name="Chronomancer"/> can strip with <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> or auto-attacks. Stripping an enemy boon will steal their life. |
| <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/>  | Players will be pushed away from one another. Make sure to not run around like a headless chicken! Find a good spot and stand still.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/>         | Enemies leave a trail of poison behind them which inflicts direct damage and the <Condition name="poisoned"/> condition. Blocking a toxic-trail attack will absorb it and cleanse the condition. It can be very dangerous when fighting multiple mobs. Removes <Boon name="Aegis"/>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| <Instability name="Fractal Vindicators"/> | Fractal Avengers are replaced by hard-hitting Fractal Vindicators. Those need to be killed as fast as possible to prevent further chaos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Hamstrung"/>           | The lower your health, the slower you move. Endurance regenerates 33% faster.
